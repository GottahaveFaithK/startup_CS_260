# Dice Duel (placeholder name)

[My Notes](notes.md)

I will make a simple dice game based on a minigame found in "Cult of The Lamb" called "knucklebones". It has 3 by 3 boards for each player, and players take turns rolling and placing dice. Points are scored based on number and placement. I will implement a computer to play against with a basic strategy that is better than pure random placements. There will be a score leaderboard that will have live updates. If I have the time, I will make different cpus to play against with different strategies, or add basic dialogue from the opponent in response to certain events.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Dice-Duel is a browser based strategy game based on "Knucklebones" from "Cult of the Lamb". Players can compete against a computer opponent by rolling and placing dice to achieve a higher score and thwart the computer. Players can track the high scores on a leaderboard and submit their own scores.

### Design

![rough_design_sketch.jpeg](rough_design_sketch.jpeg)

This is a rough sketch of the design. This is a layout idea that I will likely return to over the week, tweak, and make a more comprehensive mock-up of before doing the html. The purpose of this is to get a general idea of the elements and placement.


### Key features

- Core Game Rules - players take turns rolling and placing dice on a 3 by 3 board. Dice are scored on their number and placement, and score bonuses are generated when placing dice of the same number in the same column. Placing a die in a column eliminates any of your oponents dice with the same number in the opposite column.
- Computer Opponent - A CPU that makes legal moves each turn. The base opponent will attempt to place dice of the same number in the same column rather than making purely random moves.
- Leaderboard - Players can submit their scores to the leaderboard and can view the highest scores. The leaderboard will update live using websocket.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure game board, dice, leaderboard, score displays, and page elements such as login and headers
- **CSS** - Style the above html elements such as the board, dice, leaderboard, and adding visual buttons to the page headers. Also will be used for simple animations/transitions, such as the number appearing on the die. 
- **React** - Manage changing game states such as score updating, dice rolls, game turns, and win conditions. React components will be utilized to organize the different parts of the game. 
- **Service** - I will implement a client server architecture with multiple endpoints. These endpoints will support user registration, login, logout, and retrieving leaderboard information. The application will also make a call to the third party API: https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/
- **DB/Login** - mySQL database that tracks username, password, and authtokens. Also a db for the leaderboard, and it will hash passwords with salt.
- **WebSocket** - Server will push leaderboard updates to connected clients whenever new scores are submitted
